<h1>Playing-Against-Kasparov</h1><br>
<i>An analysis of Kasparov’s high profile games, and a guide for standing a chance against him</i><br>
<h2>Methodology</h2><br>
For this analysis, games of Kasparov against opponents with at least 2500 rating are selected.<br>
This approach reduces the sample size, provides a detailed look into Kasparov’s playing style against the best possible opponents, and increases the chances of wins by opponents and ties.<br>
For the analysis of D type openings, those which have been played less than 7 times were excluded because small sample sizes could generate misleading conclusions.<br>
